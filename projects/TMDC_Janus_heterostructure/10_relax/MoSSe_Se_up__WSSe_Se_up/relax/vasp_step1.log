|      For optimal performance we recommend to set                            |
|        NCORE= 4 - approx SQRT( number of cores)                             |
|      NCORE specifies how many cores store one orbital (NPAR=cpu/NCORE).     |
|      This setting can  greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.     |
|      The default, NPAR=number of cores might be grossly inefficient         |
|      on modern multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines.     |
|      Do your own testing !!!!                                               |
|      Unfortunately you need to use the default for GW and RPA calculations. |
|      (for HF NCORE is supported but not extensively tested yet)             |
|                                                                             |

|  ADVICE TO THIS USER RUNNING 'VASP/VAMP'   (HEAR YOUR MASTER'S VOICE ...):  |
|                                                                             |
|      You have a (more or less) 'large supercell' and for larger cells       |
|      it might be more efficient to use real space projection operators      |
|      So try LREAL= Auto  in the INCAR   file.                               |
|      Mind: If you want to do a very accurate calculations keep the          |
|      reciprocal projection scheme          (i.e. LREAL=.FALSE.)             |
|                                                                             |
